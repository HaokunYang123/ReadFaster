# Requirements: ReadFaster

**Defined:** 2026-01-26
**Core Value:** Users can read text faster by focusing on one word at a time with the pivot letter centered and highlighted.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for this milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Focus Mode

- [ ] **FOCUS-01**: Reading display automatically enters focus mode when playback starts (hides all other UI)
- [ ] **FOCUS-02**: Focus mode exits when user pauses or reading completes

### Pivot Highlighting

- [ ] **PIVOT-01**: User can select pivot letter highlight color from preset swatches in settings
- [ ] **PIVOT-02**: User can toggle pivot highlighting on/off in settings
- [ ] **PIVOT-03**: Pivot color and toggle state persist across sessions

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

(None identified)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full color picker | Preset colors sufficient, simpler UI |
| Focus mode as toggle setting | Replaced by auto-activate behavior |
