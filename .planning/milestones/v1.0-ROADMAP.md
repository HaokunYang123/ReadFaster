# Milestone v1.0: ReadFaster Enhancement

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-28
**Phases:** 1-2
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

This roadmap enhanced the existing ReadFaster RSVP reader with two user-facing improvements: automatic focus mode activation when reading starts (eliminating manual toggle) and pivot highlight customization (color selection and toggle). These features improved reading immersion and visual personalization.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Focus Mode Auto-Activation

**Goal**: Reading display automatically enters focus mode on playback start and exits on pause/completion
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Remove focus mode toggle, implement auto-activation based on playback state
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Add debouncing, click-to-pause, auto-pause settings, enhanced focus mode styling

**Details:**

Requirements covered: FOCUS-01, FOCUS-02

Success Criteria:
1. When user clicks play, UI automatically hides and only word display is visible
2. When user pauses reading, full UI returns (controls, settings, library accessible)
3. When reading completes (reaches end), full UI returns automatically
4. Focus mode state does not persist to localStorage (auto-behavior, not a setting)

Key accomplishments:
- Focus mode derived from `isPlaying && !isComplete` (no persistence needed)
- 200ms debouncing prevents transition jank
- Click-to-pause via WordDisplay click handler
- Settings button auto-pauses before opening modal
- Focus mode: 95% dim background, 20% scale increase

### Phase 2: Pivot Customization

**Goal**: User can customize pivot letter highlight appearance via settings
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Extend types with pivot settings, update CSS to use variable, wire WordDisplay
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Add Pivot Highlight section to SettingsModal with toggle, swatches, reset, preview

**Details:**

Requirements covered: PIVOT-01, PIVOT-02, PIVOT-03

Success Criteria:
1. User can select pivot highlight color from preset swatches in settings modal
2. Selected color applies immediately to word display pivot letter
3. User can toggle pivot highlighting on/off via checkbox in settings
4. When pivot highlighting is off, pivot letter appears same style as rest of word
5. Both color selection and toggle state persist across browser sessions

Key accomplishments:
- CSS variable `--pivot-color` with fallback
- `.no-highlight` class for toggle-off state
- 6 preset colors (Red, Orange, Gold, Lime Green, Sky Blue, Purple)
- Conditional reset button (hidden when default)
- Live preview in settings modal

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

None — all phases were planned from the start.

**Key Decisions:**

- Auto-activate focus mode: Simpler UX, no toggle needed (✓ Good)
- Focus mode as derived state: No persistence needed, simpler logic (✓ Good)
- Preset colors over color picker: Faster to implement, cleaner UI (✓ Good)
- CSS variables for pivot theming: Runtime changes without JS recalc (✓ Good)
- 200ms debounce timeout: Prevents jank while remaining responsive (✓ Good)
- Click-to-pause exits focus mode: Intuitive escape without dedicated UI (✓ Good)
- 95% opacity background dim: Provides context without full blackout (✓ Good)
- 6 vibrant preset colors: High contrast against dark background (✓ Good)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Eliminated manual focus mode toggle (replaced with auto-behavior)
- Hardcoded pivot color (#FF0000) replaced with CSS variable

**Issues Deferred:**

None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None
